# Single-node cluster with a single binary

First, download a prebuilt copy of TigerBeetle.

On macOS/Linux:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle; ./tigerbeetle/bootstrap.sh
```

On Windows:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle; .\tigerbeetle\bootstrap.ps1
```

Want to build from source locally? Add `-build` as an argument to the bootstrap script.

## Running TigerBeetle

Now create the TigerBeetle data file.

```bash
$ ./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=0 --replica-count=1 0_0.tigerbeetle
info(io): creating "0_0.tigerbeetle"...
info(io): allocating 660.140625MiB...
```

And start the server.

```bash
$ ./tigerbeetle start --addresses=3000 0_0.tigerbeetle
info(io): opening "0_0.tigerbeetle"...
info(main): 0: cluster=0: listening on 127.0.0.1:3000
```

Now you can connect to the running server with any client. For a quick
start, try [creating accounts and transfers in the Node
CLI](./node-cli.md).
