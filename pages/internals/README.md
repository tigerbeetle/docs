# Internals

This section collects our internal developer documentation. The
intended audience is folks who are contributing to TigerBeetle source.

It will not be particularly useful on its own for understanding
TigerBeetle at a high level.

Furthermore, it isn't particularly organized for reading. It is
primarily a reference.
