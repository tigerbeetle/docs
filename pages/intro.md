# TigerBeetle Docs

TigerBeetle is a distributed financial accounting database designed
for mission critical safety and performance.

## Quickstart

First, get TigerBeetle running:

* [Run a single-node cluster with a single binary](./quick-start/single-binary.md)
* Or [run a single-node cluster with Docker](./quick-start/with-docker.md)
* Or [run a three-node cluster with docker-compose](./quick-start/with-docker-compose.md)

Then, try creating accounts and transfers [using Node.js as a CLI](./quick-start/node-cli.md).

## Designing for TigerBeetle

When integrating TigerBeetle into your project, consider the
following:

* [TigerBeetle and consistency](./design/consistency.md)
* [Modeling application data within TigerBeetle](./design/data-modeling.md)
* [How two-phase transfers work](./design/two-phase-transfers.md)
* [How client sessions work](./design/client-sessions.md)
* [How client requests work](./design/client-requests.md)

## Recipes

Here are some common use-cases for TigerBeetle:

* [Closing accounts](./recipes/close-account.md)
* [Currency exchange](./recipes/currency-exchange.md)
